#The following simple Python project is to create a basic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library.
 The player controls a snake on the screen and the goal is to eat food (represented by a dot) to make it longer.
 If the snake hits the border of the screen or itself, the game ends.

#Project requirements:

*Install Python
*Pygame library

#The codes of this project are as follows:

  import pygame
  import random

  pygame.init()

  # Screen settings
  screen_width, screen_height = 640, 480
  screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))
  pygame.display.set_caption("Snake Game")

  # Colors
  white = (255, 255, 255)
  red = (255, 0, 0)
  green = (0, 255, 0)

# Snake settings
snake_block = 10
snake_speed = 15

# Snake function
def snake(snake_block, snake_list):
    for x in snake_list:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, green, [x[0], x[1], snake_block, snake_block])
